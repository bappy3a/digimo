<p><strong>Hi</strong></p>
It’s been an eventful, and at times alarming week. With markets price and some of the most volatile trading days in history, many are unsure of what actions — if any — they should be taking in their crypto portfolio.</p>

<strong>While we’re not in the business of  providing investment advice, it’s worth thinking through two guiding principles:</strong>

</p>

(02)<strong>Consider employing an investor best-practice:</strong> dollar-cost averaging. The idea is that instead of trying to time the market, consistent investments (i.e. $100 every month) ensure that you’re buying in at various price points.</p>

Regardless of your investment goals, we are here to support you and provide world-class crypto tools. As you develop your strategy, consider Creating an account soon so you can take action when you’re ready.
